# Npcbot_Gear_Templates

## Overview

Npcbot_Gear_Templates is a script that dumps level-based gear for easy NPC bot usage based on the player's level. Items are categorized in 5-level increments, with level 80 having an epic or rare set available. The item list has been gathered by Upskirt.

## Usage

To use this script, type the following command in-game:
.bot items [role]


### Valid Roles

- `caster`
- `physical`
- `tank`

## Important Notes

- Physical armor is relegated to leather gear, while mail and plate are relegated to tanking.
- The script is a work in progress. There are many items and levels of division that still need to be added.
- Some missing items may include weapons for particular specs or classes.

## Purpose

This script should suffice for users looking to quickly gear up bots for initial use.
